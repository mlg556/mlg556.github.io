Let us conduct a simple [_gedankenexperiment_](https://www.britannica.com/science/Gedankenexperiment) about charges, acceleration, radiation and gravity. Consider an inertial observer, $$K$$, floating in free-space. Now add to the picture a charged particle $$q$$, accelerating away from the observer $$K$$ with the acceleration $$\overrightarrow{a}$$. According to our current physics knowledge, this acceleration should produce an electromagnetic radiation emanating from the accelerated charge, which can be observed by the observer $$K$$. (See [Larmor formula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larmor_formula), [Electromagnetic field of an accelerated charge](http://www.tapir.caltech.edu/~teviet/Waves/empulse.html)). Now let us think of another observer, $$K'$$, who is co-accelerating with the charged particle. By applying [Einstein's Equivalence Principle](http://www.einstein-online.info/spotlights/equivalence_principle.html) to this system of $$K'$$ and $$q$$, we can transform the acceleration into "standing still in a uniform gravitational field". You can check out the childish drawing below if you are a bit confused.

After this transformation, a serious problem arises. If the charge still radiates, then it's a direct violation of [Law of conservation of energy](http://www.nyu.edu/classes/tuckerman/adv.chem/lectures/lecture_2/node4.html): we could just put solar panels (or antennas) around this ever-radiating charge and generate free limitless energy. If the charge does not radiate, this means we have conceded a wrong assumption somewhere along the chain: which does not seem to be the case since both _Larmor formula_ and _Einstein's Equivalence Principle_ are verified and credible explanations of natural phenomena. However, there is another hidden assumption we have made: which is that _"if some radiation is observable by $$K$$, then it is also observable by $$K'$$"_. It seems absurd to question this assumption because after all, radiation of an object must be independent from the states of the observers. ["Our consideration of charged particles in a gravitational field seems to suggest that we can always find a system of coordinates (at least locally) with respect to which a charged particle (at a given instant) does not radiate - even though the particle may be radiating at that instant with respect to some other system of coordinates."](https://www.mathpages.com/home/kmath528/kmath528.htm)

Upon tiresome research on the world-wide-web, I have failed to convince myself of an indisputable resolution to this apparent paradox. Maybe one of the readers of this post will be the one to "crack it."
