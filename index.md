Hello! I'm Mira√ß, a recent Electrical and Electronics Engineering graduate from Bilkent University.

You can check out some of the projects I did in my internships and courses:

- [Internship: Model Based Design with Simulink and DEVKIT-MPC5744P](posts\model-based-design\model-based-design.html)
- [Term Project: Guitar Tuner](posts\guitar-tuner-term-project\guitar-tuner-term-project.html)

I also write blog posts now and then:
