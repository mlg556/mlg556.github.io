Hello! I'm Mira√ß, a recent Electrical and Electronics Engineering graduate from Bilkent University.

You can check out some of the projects I did in my internships and courses:

- [Internship: Model Based Design with Simulink and DEVKIT-MPC5744P](posts\model-based-design\model-based-design.html)
  
- [Internship: Modeling a Telecommunications System in MATLAB](posts\modeling-a-telecom-system\modeling-a-telecom-system.html)

- [Internship: PID Control Ball&Beam System in Simulink](posts\ball-beam-simulink\ball-beam-simulink.html)
  
- [Term Project: Guitar Tuner](posts\guitar-tuner-term-project\guitar-tuner-term-project.html)

I also write blog posts now and then:
